College Placement Prediction
This is a toy machine learning project that predicts whether a student will get placed based on simple features like IQ and CGPA.

The dataset is artificially created (not real-world data).

It contains basic fields like IQ, CGPA, and a placement status (placed or not placed).

The project is mainly for learning purposes and demonstrates the basic workflow of a machine learning model: data preparation, training, and prediction.
