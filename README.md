# Learning Journey 

Took a long break after doing ML specialization on Coursera so, I'll be revising the ML concepts daily through CampusX 100 days of ML and I'll use other resourses too while building projects.

### Day 1


Revised tensors, axes, and ranks from 1D to 5D.

‚úÖ Key Points:
Tensor: Multi-dimensional array.

Rank: Number of dimensions (axes).

üìä Examples:
0D: Scalar ‚Üí x = 5

1D: Vector ‚Üí [1, 2, 3]

2D: Matrix ‚Üí [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

3D: shape = (2, 3, 4)

4D: Image batch ‚Üí (10, 3, 64, 64)

5D: Video batch ‚Üí (16, 10, 3, 64, 64)


### Day 2

Today did a project based on Logistic regression where I understood the overall ML process from beginning to the end. I used 100 datas (CSV) to take IQ and CGPA as a input from the sutdents and predict the Placement at a company.
