Today I started a series by Andrej Karpathy ( NN Zero to Hero ), where the first video is about building micrograd. Micrograd is a minimal autograd engine for scalar-valued computations, designed to illustrate backpropagation and automatic differentiation in deep learning. Today I completed half of the video where Andrej Taught fundamentals behind the backpropagation and how gradients are calculated. It was intresting because I got to visualize it using the Graph.
