- Learned about vertical and horizontal edge detection using convolutional filters.
- Studied padding techniques and their impact on feature extraction.
- Explored strided convolutions and how they reduce spatial dimensions.

### Online vs Offline Machine Learning

- Spent 30 minutes understanding the difference between online and offline ML models.
- Online ML updates models dynamically with new data, while offline ML trains on static datasets.
