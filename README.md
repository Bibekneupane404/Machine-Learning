# Learning Journey 

Took a long break after doing ML specialization on Coursera so, I'll be revising the ML concepts daily through CampusX 100 days of ML and I'll use other resourses too while building projects.

### Day 1


Revised tensors, axes, and ranks from 1D to 5D.

âœ… Key Points:
Tensor: Multi-dimensional array.

Rank: Number of dimensions (axes).

ðŸ“Š Examples:
0D: Scalar â†’ x = 5

1D: Vector â†’ [1, 2, 3]

2D: Matrix â†’ [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

3D: shape = (2, 3, 4)

4D: Image batch â†’ (10, 3, 64, 64)

5D: Video batch â†’ (16, 10, 3, 64, 64)


### Day 2

Today did a project based on Logistic regression where I understood the overall ML process from beginning to the end. I used 100 datas (CSV) to take IQ and CGPA as a input from the sutdents and predict the Placement at a company. 


### Day 3


Today, I learned how to frame a Machine Learning (ML) problem effectively.
The key steps I focused on were:

Understanding the Problem: Before thinking about models or data, it's important to clearly define the goal. For example, if the objective is to lower the churn rate, I first need to deeply understand what churn means in the specific context.

Identifying the Problem Type: Once the goal is clear, I work on framing it as an ML task â€” for instance, predicting whether a customer will churn (a classification problem).

Thinking About Solutions: After identifying the problem, I brainstorm different ways ML could help solve it, such as building a model to predict churn early so interventions can be made.

Overall, the big idea is:
Understand first, model later.


### Day 4

Used pandas to work with CSV files.

Learned to read CSVs from local files and URLs using pd.read_csv().

Explored data with head(), tail(), shape, info(), and describe().

Handled missing values using isnull(), dropna(), and fillna().

Saved DataFrames to CSV using to_csv().


### Day 5

Learned how to work with Json Files and tried few example datasets form kaggle.

Learned how to work with SQL data and tried it one example dataset from kaggle.

Mostly learned about reaading the data in Pandas.

Learned about torch.tensors from documentation.


### Day 6

Today I learned how to Fetch data using an API and convert into a CSV format.

I used API from a TMDP (movie website) and used most popular movies, then I used the API to gather all the data into CSV form.


### Day 7

I started learning Pytorch so today I learned about tensor creation and learned about tensor datatypes.
