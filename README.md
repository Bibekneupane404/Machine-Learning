# Learning Journey 

Took a long break after doing ML specialization on Coursera so, I'll be revising the ML concepts daily through CampusX 100 days of ML and I'll use other resourses too while building projects.

### Day 1


Revised tensors, axes, and ranks from 1D to 5D.

✅ Key Points:
Tensor: Multi-dimensional array.

Rank: Number of dimensions (axes).

📊 Examples:
0D: Scalar → x = 5

1D: Vector → [1, 2, 3]

2D: Matrix → [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

3D: shape = (2, 3, 4)

4D: Image batch → (10, 3, 64, 64)

5D: Video batch → (16, 10, 3, 64, 64)


### Day 2

Today did a project based on Logistic regression where I understood the overall ML process from beginning to the end. I used 100 datas (CSV) to take IQ and CGPA as a input from the sutdents and predict the Placement at a company. 


### Day 3


Today, I learned how to frame a Machine Learning (ML) problem effectively.
The key steps I focused on were:

Understanding the Problem: Before thinking about models or data, it's important to clearly define the goal. For example, if the objective is to lower the churn rate, I first need to deeply understand what churn means in the specific context.

Identifying the Problem Type: Once the goal is clear, I work on framing it as an ML task — for instance, predicting whether a customer will churn (a classification problem).

Thinking About Solutions: After identifying the problem, I brainstorm different ways ML could help solve it, such as building a model to predict churn early so interventions can be made.

Overall, the big idea is:
Understand first, model later.
